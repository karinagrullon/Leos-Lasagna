            Leo’s Lasagne actually represents three different names. The current owner is Leo. The previous owner was his father also named Leo and prior to him his grandfather also named Leo! The incredible family recipe initially created by Leo’s grandfather who lived in Nepal. After his grandfather's return from World War II grandfather Leo learned the recipe from his mother and discovered his love for cooking. Eager to share the delicious taste of the incredible family meal led to the idea to create a business and Leo’s Lasagne took off! Leo’s father continued the traditional recipe and brought it to Brooklyn,
            New York. Leo’s father has taught him the recipe and the tradition continues to thrive!
